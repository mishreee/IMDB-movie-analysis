# IMDB-movie-analysis
The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset containing information about
various movies from IMDb. The dataset consists of multiple columns with
details such as movie title, director name, IMDb rating, budget, gross, and other
relevant information. The project involves framing a problem, cleaning the data,
exploring the dataset, and deriving insights from it.
The analysis tasks include identifying movies with the highest profit,
determining the IMDb Top 250 movies and top foreign language films, finding
the best directors based on IMDb scores, identifying popular genres, and
exploring the impact of lead actors such as Meryl Streep, Leonardo DiCaprio,
and Brad Pitt. Additionally, trends in user voting over decades will be
visualized. The project aims to provide a detailed report that presents the
analysis findings in a cohesive and engaging data story.
